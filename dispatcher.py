class Dispatcher:
    """A dispatcher fulfills requests from riders and drivers for a
    ride-sharing service.

    When a rider requests a driver, the dispatcher assigns a driver to the
    rider. If no driver is available, the rider is placed on a waiting
    list for the next available driver. A rider that has not yet been
    picked up by a driver may cancel their request.

    When a driver requests a rider, the dispatcher assigns a rider from
    the waiting list to the driver. If there is no rider on the waiting list
    the dispatcher does nothing. Once a driver requests a rider, the driver
    is registered with the dispatcher, and will be used to fulfill future
    rider requests.
